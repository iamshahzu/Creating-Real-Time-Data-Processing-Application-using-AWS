# Creating-Real-Time-Data-Processing-Application-using-AWS
A streamlined data processing pipeline built entirely with AWS. This project extracts data from Google BigQuery using AWS Glue, streams it via Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose, and leverages an AWS Lambda function to load the data into Amazon Redshift for real-time analytics.
